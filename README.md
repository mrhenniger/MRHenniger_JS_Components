# MRHenniger_JS_Utilities
Components for HTML/CSS/JS written by Mike R Henniger

This is a collection of web components written me, Mike Henniger.  The components make use of a set of JavaScript 
utilities (see repository "MRHenniger_JS_Utilities") based on vanilla JS and avoid bloated frameworks with frequent 
updates which make hobby projects difficult to keep current.  

The intent is to eventually make these components reactive.  It is a work in progress.  I am getting there so feel free
to return and see how things are going.

These components are being tested in another project (not yet available to you on GitHub), and will be augmented in the 
future.  I would be interested to hear what you have to say about what you see here.  Constructive 
criticism is always well received.  And suggestions or requests for new functions and behaviors are encouraged.

Revision log...

V1 - July 13 -      Added the first component, Center Text.  Simply centers text in a div.  Has some simple styling
                    enums, but they are not fancy.

V0 - July 5 -       Just getting something under source control.  Nothing to see here... yet.  :-)

2025:  Happy new year!!!!!!!
